# How To Play

Move your cursor within the rectangular box and eat smaller dots by hovering and sliding over them. Be careful though! If a larger dot comes your way, it will consume you when it moves over you. Avoid the larger dots that come your way by moving your cursor around them to dodge.

Your score will be shown at the top of the screen and indicates how many dots you have consumed without being eaten yourself. If you get eaten, simply click on the words "Try Again", which will come up on the screen.

Keep in mind, you cannot eat dots that are your size, but they also cannot consume you.
