    <p>  This project is a recreation of some of the mini games in the online game, Amoung Us. My primary task in this project was to recreate the Amoung Us 
      Leaf Clean Up task, which is located in the reactor room of the game. Users can travel through different parts of the map by clicking on the room 
      they desire to go to. This map was intentionally designed so that the user can not revisit previous main rooms of the map without making a full circle of the
      map.  </p>

      game, the user faces randomized moves of the computer.

        The fourth project presented is a Math Visualizer for created for Grade 12 students to develop a greater understanding of vectors and vectors operations,
      using application questions, drag and drop features, and visual components to help students understand these concepts. In this project, I primarily worked
      on the Vector Addition and Dot Product question pages. Furthermore, I developed the template that was used for the Vector Subtraction and Dot Product question 
      pages. This included the feature to allow the vectors to be dragged and placed in the correct position, as well to receive user input for their answer and provide them
      with the necessary feedback.

    <p > The above first two projects showcase some of the work that I have created in 
      group environments. The first project listed is a website that provides students from kindergarten to grade 5 with randomized math questions from four 
      categories, and times how long it takes for them to complete ten questions of the type they have selected.
